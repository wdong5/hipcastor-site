- title: "TrackFM: Far-out Compiler Support for a Far Memory World"
  description: This paper introduces the compiler-based approach to far memory. Prior approaches leverage either the OS kernel's paging subsystem or a library in userspace. The latter requires code changes, and the former introduces I/O overheads. We present the first approach that uses the compiler for automatic far memory.

- title: "Near-term Ecological Forecasting for Climate Change Action"
  description:  Ecological forecasts can be used to predict changes in ecosystems and subsequent impacts on communities. In addition to long-term projections, there is an important need for forecasts in shorter-term decision-making time periods of weeks and months. Scientists at the Ecological Forecasting Initiative are working to advance the field through a process that enables them to continually update model predictions with observed data in order to improve our ability to foresee what may happen in the future.
