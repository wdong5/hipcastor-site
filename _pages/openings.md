# Open positions

**We are currently looking to recruit PhD students, and undergraduate researchers! EECS at OSU is also hiring faculty**

## Faculty Positions
The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University (OSU) seeks to fill multiple full-time (1.00 FTE), 9-month, tenure-track or tenured position, at the rank of Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor, in the areas of high-performance computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). For more information, see [the job posting](https://jobs.oregonstate.edu/postings/161506).

## Grad Student Openings
We are looking for students with a rigorous academic background and a solid foundation in math and computer engineering/science with a minimum bachelor’s degree in ECE or CS and a high GPA. Candidates with an MS degree and strong background in computer systems (including virtualization, operating systems, distributed systems) will be given preference. 

Openings are for ongoing and emerging projects that focus on various aspects of systems and HPC research, including: distributed systems, serverless computing, computer architecture, operating systems, systems for machine learning, virtualization, and high-impact inter-disciplinary applications that use advanced cyberinfrastructure.

### Why study at Oregon State?

**You'll be embedded with experts across disciplines** The School of EECS has research areas of excellence in networking and computer systems, AI and robotics, cybersecurity, and data science and engineering. Research projects rooted in HPC can leverage inter-disciplinary collaborations within and beyond the College of Engineering to deliver high-impact research in areas including AI for science and advanced cyberinfrastructure for emerging applications.

**You'll have access to state-of-the-art facilities** OSU will also soon be home of the [Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/huang-cic). The $213 million complex — including two $50 million gifts to the OSU Foundation from alumni couple Jen-Hsun and Lori Mills Huang and the Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation — will increase OSU’s support for the semiconductor and technology industry in Oregon and beyond when it opens in 2026.The complex will harness one of the nation’s most powerful supercomputers and a cleanroom to advance research and learning in artificial intelligence, robotics and materials science.

**Location, location, location** OSU is located in Corvallis, consistently
ranked among the best places for work-life balance. It is a bike-friendly town
within easy driving distance from Portland, the spectacular Pacific coast, and
the snow-capped Cascade mountain range. Corvallis is right in the middle of
Oregon's temperate and beautiful Willamette Valley, Oregon's productive wine
region. Whether you're into winter sports, mountain biking, hiking,
backpacking, or tasting wine, there's something close by for you, and you're
always surrounded by the rich natural beauty of the region. The famous Oregon
Coast is less than an hour drive to the West, the Cascade crest is a little
more than two hours to the East. A little further and you're in the high desert 
around Bend. To the South is Crater Lake National Park and
California's breathtaking Redwood forests. If you need a big city vibe,
Portland is only a little more than an hour to the North.
