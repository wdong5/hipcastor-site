# Research

Our overarching goal is to research and develop new techniques applied to
a diverse spectrum of computer systems (including edge, cloud and
high-performance computing) and across layers of abstraction (including
computer architecture, operating systems, virtualization, middleware, software engineering, and
applications). 

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Function-as-a-Service, serverless workflows.** Modern Function-as-a-Service
(FaaS) cloud platforms offer great potential for supporting event-driven
scientific workflows. Nonetheless, there remain barriers to adoption by the
scientific community in domains such as environmental sciences, where R is the
focal language used for the development of applications and where users are
typically not well-versed with FaaS APIs. We have designed and implemented
[FaaSr](https://faasr.io), a novel open-source middleware that supports
event-driven scientific workflows in R. A key novelty in FaaSr is the ability
to deploy workflows across FaaS providers without the need for any managed
servers for coordination. We have also explored using lightweight per-function
virtual machines ([virtines](https://github.com/virtines/wasp)) to enable more strongly isolated FaaS platforms.

**Modern high-performance memory systems.** Modern memory systems involve
designs aimed at surmounting the "memory wall," where memory capacity and
bandwidth can limit workload performance. We are investigating new system
software support for disaggregated memory, where a workload's memory is
transparently expanded across nodes in a cluster. In particular, we developed
a new compiler and runtime system for high-performance far memory called
[TrackFM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617232.3624856). To address memory
bandwidth limitations, near-data processing architectures move compute nearer
to memory, for example with processing units integrated near DRAM banks. We are
investigating new software and hardware abstractions for next-generation
processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures. 

**Specialized system software for HPC.** We are interested in ground-up redesigns of the
hardware/software layer for high-performance computing. In the past, we have developed new
[operating systems](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~pdinda/Papers/sc21.pdf), [virtual machine monitors](https://github.com/virtines/wasp), 
[languages](https://doi.org/10.1145/3453483.3460969), [compilers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617232.3624856), and [hardware designs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8842897) for HPC. 

**Software-defined virtual networks for edge-to-cloud computing.** While
within cloud data centers, nodes can communicate without the presence of
Network Address Translators (NATs), edge computing applications require devices
to communicate across different private networks and must deal with NAT
traversal to enable edge-to-edge communication. We have designed and
implemented [EdgeVPN](https://edgevpn.io), a technique that enables
virtual private Ethernet networks that span edge and cloud resources
– including those constrained by NAT and firewall middleboxes. EdgeVPN builds
upon a scalable structured peer-to-peer overlay, and
integrates overlay tunnels with Software Defined Networking (SDN) software
switches to create a virtual network with dynamic membership – supporting
unmodified Ethernet/IP stacks to facilitate the deployment of edge
applications.
